"""
generator.py - AI-Powered Content Generation for Ideation CLI.

This module provides functions to generate game ideas, branding, and cover images
using OpenAI's API. It supports multiple ideation techniques and metadata generation
for game development projects.

Functions:
    - generate_ideas(artifact, technique, count, output, model):
      Creates game-related ideas based on user-defined ideation techniques.
    - generate_name(prompt, model):
      Generates a game name based on a given prompt.
    - generate_branding(prompt_task, prompt_name, model):
      Produces game branding metadata, including descriptions and tags.
    - generate_cover(prompt_task, prompt_name, dir_path):
      Generates and saves a pixel art cover image using DALLÂ·E.

Constants:
    - OPENAI_CLIENT: OpenAI API client instance.
    - DIRNAME: Path to the current module's directory.

Dependencies:
    - os
    - json
    - requests
    - openai
    - ideation_cli.prompts (for structured idea prompts)
    - ideation_cli.utils (for input validation)

Usage:
    ```python
    from generator import generate_name

    name = generate_name("A strategy game about space exploration")
    print(name)
    ```
