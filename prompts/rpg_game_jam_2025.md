**Prompt for the LLM:**

You are tasked with generating a creative and original game idea for the RPG MAKER 2025 GAME JAM. Your idea must be implementable using Gotcha Gotcha Game's Maker series engine. The game should embody the theme **"Beyond Expectations"** by pushing creative boundaries—whether by challenging players to exceed their perceived limits, achieving unprecedented feats, or introducing innovative mechanics that defy conventional RPG norms.

In your response, please address the following criteria:

1. **Theme Integration:**  
   - Clearly incorporate the "Beyond Expectations" theme. Explain how your game concept challenges typical limits or surprises players with innovative twists.

2. **Narrative & World-Building:**  
   - Present a compelling story or world that encourages players to explore and overcome challenges.
   - Include potential character arcs, plot points, and any narrative mechanics that elevate the theme.

3. **Gameplay Mechanics:**  
   - Outline unique gameplay elements or mechanics that reflect the idea of exceeding expectations.
   - Consider how these mechanics can offer a fresh experience compared to standard RPG gameplay.

4. **Art & Sound Direction:**  
   - Describe a visual and audio style that reinforces the game’s atmosphere and theme.
   - Remember that all art and sound must be manually created or legally sourced (no generative AI art).

5. **Practical Considerations:**  
   - Ensure that the game is designed to be developed within a four-week game jam.
   - The playable experience should have a minimum duration of 15 minutes (with judging based on the first hour).
   - The final game must be PG-13 and Windows-compatible.
   - Original content should be created during the jam period, though pre-existing assets can be used if properly credited.

6. **Additional Features (Optional):**  
   - Consider elements that might earn special category awards such as Most Innovative Gameplay, Best Narrative, or Best Use of Theme.
   - Highlight any aspects that could set your game apart, such as interactive storytelling, dynamic difficulty, or unusual character progression systems.

Your final output should be a detailed, coherent game concept that includes a narrative overview, gameplay mechanics, artistic vision, and any special features that make your idea truly "beyond expectations."
